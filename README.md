**C++ exercises**

Some solutions to the questions on HackerRank and LeetCode.
For each file, the first capitalized letter are indicating the difficulty of the question:\
\t E - easy
\t M - medium
\t H - hard\

I'll put some Python solutions in another repo when I have time.
I'll also organize the repo prettier when I populate it with more exercises.
