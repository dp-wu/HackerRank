# LC_HR_Cpp
**C++ exercises**

Some solutions to the questions on HackerRank and LeetCode.\
For each file, the first capitalized letter is indicating the difficulty of the question:<br />
E - easy \
M - medium \
H - hard<br />

I'll put some Python solutions in another repo when I have time.\
I'll also organize the repo prettier when I populate it with more exercises.
